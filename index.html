        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>This project was part of the ENPH 253 course, taken by second-year UBC Engineering Physics students during the summer. 
            The course is known for its annual robot competition in August and is commonly referred to as “Robot Summer”. In teams 
            of 3-4 people, the students are given 6 weeks to build a robot for a unique competition each year. The students do 
            everything from scratch, including designing schematics for PCBs, soldering, designing the robot in CAD, building the 
            prototype, and programming the robot to function autonomously. Most teams, including ours, spent 60-70 hours per week 
            in the lab attempting to make the best robot in the class. The project took a lot of effort and with lots of help from 
            our instructors, we all learned a lot about prototyping, troubleshooting, design, and much more.

        <h2>Competition Details</h2>
        <p>This year the competition was based on the video game Overcooked. Overcooked is a cooking game where the player and 1-3 
            other chefs work together to fulfill customer orders within a time limit. The game itself is hard and this year's 
            competition increased the difficulty by challenging students to build two autonomous robots to play it in real life. 
            The goal was to score as many points as possible in two minutes by making an assortment of burgers, fries, and salads 
            (made of 3D-printed plastic food). Each recipe was worth a different number of points, according to difficulty (see the 
            Points Table below). The teams could choose which recipes their robots would fulfill and the team that could score the 
            most points in a two-minute round would ultimately win the competition.
