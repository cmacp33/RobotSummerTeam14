            <h2>Chassis</h2>
            <p>Our chassis was designed in Solidworks and manufactured using the UBC laser cutter. The material used was MDF 
                (hardboard) that was spray-painted black after being cut. A thin, 3D-printed cylinder located at each corner 
                allowed us to screw on and off the top of the chassis.

            <h2>Claw</h2>
            <p>The claw was made with a four-bar linkage to clamp the food and plate. A servo motor controlled the movement 
                of the four-bar linkage and was programmed to close the claw to different set angles, depending on the size 
                of the item to be picked up. The four-bar linkage was made of acrylic and aluminum sheet metal. Two 3D-printed 
                pieces with sponges were attached to the end of four-bar linkage, allowing the claw to mold slightly to the 
                shape of the item it was clamping. With only two points of contact, the flexible sponge provided better grip 
                when picking up the food. The four-bar linkage was attached to a piece of MDF that moved up and down thanks 
                to a leadscrew driven by a DC motor. The ability to move up and down allowed the robot to pick up food at 
                counter height and stack the item on top of the burger being made on another area of the counter.</p>

            <h2>Stacking Platform</h2>
            <p>A 3D-printed platform was added to one of the robots, allowing the robot to carry the plate and stack the food 
                directly on the platform before serving. The platform moved inwards and outwards thanks to a rack and pinion 
                driven by a continuous servo motor.</p>
